# Command-Recognition
This project aims to transfer learn a CNN to recognize a small library of words

The dataset used is the Fluent Speech Commands Dataset known as FluentAI which can be downloaded here: https://fluent.ai/fluent-speech-commands-a-dataset-for-spoken-language-understanding-research/
This project should be run on Google Colab.
This project requires that the dataset be downloaded and the folder inside the extract file named '\fluent_speech_commands_dataset' be saved to one's Google Drive.

###
Please run the *Data_Preprocessor.ipynb* file. This file runs but the Preprocessing stage takes many hours. 
When this is done. You can either download the files to a .zip which then be uploaded to Colab or you can select the option to download the data directly from Drive to Colab.
Once the data is in Colab, adjust root folders as necessary and run the *Trainer.ipynb*
